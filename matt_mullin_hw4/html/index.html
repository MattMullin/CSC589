<h2>CSC 589 AU / Homework 4 / Image Blending Using Pyramids</h2>


<p>This project was an attempt to use gaussian and laplacian pyramids to blend images together smoothly. The results were not ideal for 
a variety of reasons, mainly due to my lack of experience with python in general as well as a lack of understanding about how to properly mix 
images using this technique. The steps for mixing images using gaussian and laplacian pyramids are: </p>

<div>
<img align="right" width='40%' src="blended_apple.png"/>
<!-- <p align="right" style="font-size: 14px">Example of a right floating element.</p> -->
</div>

<ol>
<li>Create a laplacian pyramid for both of the input images</li>
<li>Create a gaussian pyramid for the mask</li>
<li>Attempt to blend the two laplacian images and the mask at every level of the pyramid while reconstructing it</li>
<li>Combine all of the outputs to create the final blended image</li>
</ol>

<p>The image to the right is a colored output from the 'blended' function. It was an attempt to combine an apple and an orange. 
The rendering wasnt fully sucessful, but there is a portion of the orange which partially blended with the original image..</p>

<h3>Challenges with This Project</h3>



<h2>Creating the Gaussian and Laplcacian pyramids</h2>
<p>The two functions below were created in order to render the gaussian and laplacian pyramids. This is a very 
ineffieicnt way to repreat tasks with code however, I had great difficulty trying to create a loop that would accomplish the same
task. The process used the fundamental priciples of creating image pyramids which is blurring the image before scaling it down in order to 
preserve details and not cause artifacts. For the laplacian pyramid, a 5x5 kernal was convolved with the input image and then it was used to subtract with the 
orginal laplacian image, and then was scaled down. </p>

<h2>Reconstructing the Images</h2>
<p>After the laplacian and gaussian pyramids were created, they were combined together and then needed to be reconstructed to the proper size.
The following code is the process used to resize the image. There were many problems with this script which caused the images to remain very 
blurry when they were scaled back to the orignal size. This is another example where much of this code could have been reduced using a loop.</p>

<pre><code>
def reconstruct(combined):
    gaussian_kernel = (1.0/256)*np.array([[1, 4,  6,  4,  1],
    					[4, 16, 24, 16, 4],
    					[6, 24, 72, 24, 6],
    					[4, 16, 24, 16, 4],
    					[1, 4,  6,  4,  1]])
    alpha = 30

    combined_expanded = scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom(combined, 2)
    combined_blur = filters.convolve(combined_expanded,gaussian_kernel, mode='reflect')    
    combined_sharp = combined_expanded + alpha * (combined_expanded - combined_blur)

    combined_expanded2 = scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom(combined_expanded, 2)
    combined_blur2 = filters.convolve(combined_expanded2,gaussian_kernel, mode='reflect')    
    combined_sharp2 = combined_expanded2 + alpha * (combined_expanded2 - combined_blur2)

    combined_expanded3 = scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom(combined_expanded2, 2)
    combined_blur3 = filters.convolve(combined_expanded3,gaussian_kernel, mode='reflect')    
    combined_sharp3 = combined_expanded3 + alpha * (combined_expanded3 - combined_blur3)

    combined_expanded4 = scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom(combined_expanded3, 2)
    combined_blur4 = filters.convolve(combined_expanded4,gaussian_kernel, mode='reflect')    
    combined_sharp4 = combined_expanded4 + alpha * (combined_expanded4 - combined_blur4)

    combined_expanded5 = scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom(combined_expanded4, 2)
    combined_blur5 = filters.convolve(combined_expanded5,gaussian_kernel, mode='reflect')    
    combined_sharp5 = combined_expanded5 + alpha * (combined_expanded5 - combined_blur5)

<h2>Blending Colored Images Together </h2>
<p>This set of code deals with taking colored images and blending them together smoothly. The first step was to split the image
into its 3 color bands and then apply a gaussian blur to each one. Then the laplacian image was created by subtracting that gaussian by the original image.
The laplacian bands from each image were then combined together through addition. The images were then combined by  adding the mixed laplacians for each band 
and then compliing the seperate bands back into a single image. This process was never fully implemented into the pyramid functions becasue whenever the code would run,
an error involving the multiple color bands would appear, so I would have to flatten the image.</p>

<pre><code>

def blend(img1,img2):

    b, g, r    = img1[:, :, 0], img1[:, :, 1], img1[:, :, 2] # For RGB image
    b2, g2, r2    = img2[:, :, 0], img2[:, :, 1], img2[:, :, 2] # For RGB image

    					[1, 4,  6,  4,  1]])
    gaussian_blur_b = filters.convolve(b,gaussian_kernel, mode='reflect')
    gaussian_blur_g = filters.convolve(g,gaussian_kernel, mode='reflect')

    laplacian_r2 = gaussian_blur_r2 - r2

    mixed_laplacian_b = laplacian_b+laplacian_b2
    mixed_laplacian_g = laplacian_g+laplacian_g2
    mixed_laplacian_r = laplacian_r+laplacian_r2

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, this project was very challenging but I learned a great deal about computing functions with images. It is dissapointing that I was not able to get the 
pyramids fully functioning, however with a few adjustments it should be able to run correctly. Gaining more knowledge in the programming language will help with improving 
the script more effiently, and I hope to replace the majority of the code by using 'for' loops. Blending the images while preserving color was very difficult but very interesting. I enjoyed the challenge of building this script completley from scratch but it was very challenging and I hope to be able to improve the code in order to render some actual results. </p>
